INSTALLING WINDOWS IN KVM/QEMU
https://youtu.be/wxxP39cNJOs?t=404
In a nutshel:
- install virt-manger etc, i really have no idea what each part is for so I just installed all this (sudo pacman -S qemu virt-manager virt-viewer dnsmasq vde2 bridge-utils openbsd-netcat) from here https://computingforgeeks.com/install-kvm-qemu-virt-manager-arch-manjar/ and anything else it needs from that page (libguestfs, ebtables, iptables) without uninstalling anything that I currently have
- remember to do this step from there also: sudo systemctl enable --now libvirtd.service
- and then check that it's working  systemctl status libvirtd.service again all this stuff is on that page
- in virt-manager, new vm > local install media
- preferences > make sure enable xml editing is enabled
- when setting up vm settings with the win10 iso, change the NIC "Device model" and the SATA Disk 1 "Disk bus" to "virtio"
- change CPUs as needed
- get the following file:
https://fedorapeople.org/groups/virt/virtio-win/direct-downloads/archive-virtio/
^ here, go into the most recent folder and get virtio-win.iso
- back in virt-manager do add hardware > storage > and set Device Type to CDROM
- in SATA CDROM 2 mount the virtio-win.iso
- begin installation
- when you get to the part where you have a button about Custom Install, choose that and select load driver > ok > file that ends in w10\viostor.inf
- next > proceed with normal install and setup
- windows won't have internet until you go into device manager and use the drivers on that iso (virtio-win.iso) to install the stuff that has a yellow exclamation in device manager

**********************************
VMWARE HORIZON, DOD CAC READER CERTS
The instructions at the arch wiki work perfectly, https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Common_Access_Card
When you're all done, to use vmware horizon you have to go into file > preferences > enable "Do not verify server identity certificates."

Installation

Install ccid and opensc from official repositories.
Configuration

Note: You should not have to edit your opensc configuration files by default. You should check all other setup items first (e.g. certificate imports)

If your card reader does not have a pin pad, uncomment enable_pinpad = false in /etc/opensc.conf.

Sometimes opensc can struggle to identify the proper driver for CAC, instead it may choose PIV or something else. You can force the CAC driver by editing /etc/opensc.conf for card_drivers = cac and force_card_driver = cac
Enable pcscd

Start and enable pcscd.socket.
Configure browser

    Go to: https://public.cyber.mil/pki-pke/pkipke-document-library/
    Download certs: "PKI CA Certificate Bundles: PKCS#7 For DoD PKI Only - Version 5.9" (ZIP Download)
    Unzip the DoD PKI zip
    Follow browser-specific instructions

Firefox
Load security device

Navigate to Edit -> Preference -> Advanced -> Certificates -> Security Devices and click "Load" to load a module using /usr/lib/opensc-pkcs11.so or /usr/lib/pkcs11/opensc-pkcs11.so.

Note: Firefox may report the module did not load correctly however you will have to check in the security devices to confirm whether the module properly loaded or not
Import the DoD Certificates

Install the certificates from the mentioned zip-file in this order, by going to Edit -> Preference -> Advanced -> Certificates -> View Certificates -> Authorities -> Import (make sure to at-least check the box for "Trust this CA to identify websites"):

Note: As of the 5.9 version of the certificate zip

    Certificates_PKCS7_v5.9_DoD.der.p7b
    Certificates_PKCS7_v5.9_DoD_DoD_Root_CA_2.der.p7b
    Certificates_PKCS7_v5.9_DoD_DoD_Root_CA_3.der.p7b
    Certificates_PKCS7_v5.9_DoD_DoD_Root_CA_4.der.p7b
    Certificates_PKCS7_v5.9_DoD_DoD_Root_CA_5.der.p7b
    Certificates_PKCS7_v5.9_DoD.pem.p7b

Chromium/Google Chrome

1. Add the CAC Module to the NSS DB.

Ensure that your CAC is connected, that Chromium is closed and enter the following in a terminal: $ modutil -dbdir sql:$HOME/.pki/nssdb/ -add "CAC Module" -libfile /usr/lib/opensc-pkcs11.so

Note: You may see the message 'Failure to load dynamic library'. This can be ignored.

Upon success you will see "Module "CAC Module" added to database."

2. Check if the CAC Module was successfully added with $ modutil -dbdir sql:$HOME/.pki/nssdb/ -list

Tango-inaccurate.pngThe factual accuracy of this article or section is disputed.Tango-inaccurate.png

Reason: The following step is NOT WORKING WITH v5.4 of certs because Chrome does not exist in the filenames, I think it should be Certificate instead of Chrome) (Discuss in Talk:Common Access Card)

3. Navigate (in a shell) to the location of the unzip DoD PKI files and install via:

 for n in $(ls * | grep Chrome); do certutil -d sql:$HOME/.pki/nssdb -A -t TC -n $n -i $n; done

or

Re-open Chrome, Navigate to Settings -> Show Advanced Settings -> Manage Certificates -> Authorities to load CA bundle from the PEM-formatted file from above.

4. Verify the authority is in Chrome under Settings -> Show Advanced Settings -> Manage Certificates -> Authorities then expand "org-U.S. Government" and you should see a number of "DoD" certificates listed.
VMware Horizon Client

Install vmware-horizon-clientAUR, vmware-horizon-usbAUR, and vmware-horizon-smartcardAUR. Start and enable vmware-horizon-usb.service.

To integrate CAC authentication with the VMware Horizon Client, create the directory /usr/lib/vmware/view/pkcs11 and link the pkcs11 library:

# ln -s /usr/lib64/pkcs11/opensc-pkcs11.so /usr/lib/vmware/view/pkcs11/libopenscpkcs11.so



**********************************
install kwalletmanager and set the password to an empty password, that way the system will not constantly nag you for yet another password every time it tries to do anything (this non-nagging is the default way on every other OS, it's separate from when things often ask you for your root/login password which is normal)

**********************************
KDE SETTINGS ADJUSTMENTS
remember to toggle on the keyboard shortcuts for switching desktops left and right, that way i can use the mouse to switch desktops by assigning mouse keys to those keyboard shortcuts

**********************************
KEYCHRON K10 KEYBOARD
The function keys will not disable, even after holding fn+x+l four 4 seconds in windows mode and seeing the keyboard respond by blinking. What's happening is that it is disabling (at least, it's now set that way in the keyboard, and if you do it again it will unset it), but linux hasn't been set up to acknowledge the change. To make the change noticed on the linux side, run
>> echo 0 | sudo tee /sys/module/hid_apple/parameters/fnmode
and to make it permanent, run
>> echo "options hid_apple fnmode=0" | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/hid_apple.conf
(the above command simply adds the line
options hid_apple fnmode=0
to a file called hid_apple.conf, and creates the file if it doesn't exist).
https://mikeshade.com/posts/keychron-linux-function-keys/

Next, because you have to be in windows mode for the above to work, you can remap the meta key to be in mac mode by using Input Remapper
>> sudo pacaur -S input-remapper-git

May also be recommended to fix bluetooth constantly disconnecting requiring reboot, to do this requires disabling keyboard sleeping (happens after 10min of no use). Hold fn+s+o for 4 seconds.

**********************************************
- TAP TO CLICK IS GRAYED OUT IN KDE
You have to be using wayland. When using wayland, gestures may get fucky. See the next tip on touchpad gestures to resolve it.

**********************************************
- GET TOUCHPAD GESTURES AND PALM REJECTION WORKING IN KDE
1. use wayland, because only it supports libinput rather than synaptics
2. things should work, but if they aren't, consider the following. Install
sudo pacman -S --needed wmctrl xdotool
git clone https://github.com/bulletmark/libinput-gestures.git
cd libinput-gestures
sudo ./libinput-gestures-setup install
(or if that doesn't work, i think you just need to install libinput-gestures, more info at the site on the next line)
https://github.com/bulletmark/libinput-gestures
This command makes it start with the system
libinput-gestures-setup autostart start
Put the conf file here:
~/.config/libinput-gestures.conf
use
libinput-gestures-setup stop
and
libinput-gestures-setup start
to make it recognize new changes to the conf file whenever you make adjustments to it

**********************************************
- GETTING ZSH SET UP
Check shell with
echo $SHELL

ARCH GNOME GUIDE FOR XPS 9720

- additional packages as described above
- get firefox set up (git clone this repo, and add the settings for cookie autodelete and ublock origin)
- install yay and pamac-aur per the instructions above
- in pamac settings, toggle AUR on
- download apps as needed (e.g. vs code (visual-studio-code-bin), discord, steam (native))
^- to install steam, first enable multilib in /etc/pacman.conf like this:
>> sudo nano /etc/pacman.conf
uncomment these lines
#[multilib]
#Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
exit and save with ctrl+x > ctrl+y > enter
^then install steam (not steam native) from pamac
if it doesn't show, the multilib database may not have been downloaded, so you can install it via CLI with
>> sudo pacman -Sy steam (the -y part I guess forces it to get necessary databases)
- to install gnome extensions, you need the browser extension (linked in the gnome extensions website) and to get around the error "No such native application org.gnome.chrome_gnome_shell" you need gnome-browser-connector from the AUR
- to get sound working, install sof-firmware
- to get past the error "filesystem type ntfs3,ntfs not configured in kernel" when opening ntfs USB drives, do the following:
>> sudo nano /etc/udisks2/mount_options.conf
then add
[defaults]
ntfs_defaults=uid=$UID,gid=$GID,noatime,prealloc
exit and save with ctrl+x > ctrl+y > enter
- to get bluetooth working, run:
>> sudo systemctl enable --now bluetooth.service
- add keyboard shortcut for the terminal (called kgx):
Settings > keyboard > view and customize shortcuts > custom shortcuts > add shortcut > Terminal; kgx; super + return > add
- to theme qt apps, install kvantum > change/delete theme > select theme > use this theme, then:
add the following to /etc/profile:
# use kvantum as qt themer
export QT_STYLE_OVERRIDE=kvantum
- to make old gtk apps match the dark theme, install gnome-tweaks and gnome-themes-extra, then go into gnome-tweaks > appearance, and set "legacy applications" to "Adwaita-dark" (or whatever theme)
- to change the GDM login wallpaper (this is not the same as the lockscreen wallpaper, which is just the desktop wallpaper but blurred) use arch-change-gdm-background from here: https://github.com/anirudhgupta109/arch-change-gdm-background
- to get the fingerprint sensor working on this machine, install fprintd and then set up the fingerprint in settings (that's in gnome, not sure how to do it in other DEs)
- to get back/forward gestures working in firefox, add MOZ_ENABLE_WAYLAND=1 to /etc/environment
- to add kernel parameters, include it in the quoted section at the end of this line:
GRUB_CMDLINE-LINX-DEFAULT=""
inside /etc/default/grab
then run
>> sudo grub-update (may need to install grub-update first)
that's from this guide here https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-set-kernel-boot-parameters-on-linux
- disable hot corner in settings > multitasking

Apps:
variety, steam, discord, vscode, dconf editor (will need for some things like disabling double tap to drag)

Extensions:
- dash to panel
https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1160/dash-to-panel/
https://github.com/home-sweet-gnome/dash-to-panel
- clipboard history

https://github.com/SUPERCILEX/gnome-clipboard-history
- AppIndicator and KStatusNotifierItem Support (needed to show discord, steam, variety, etc.)
https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/615/appindicator-support/
https://github.com/ubuntu/gnome-shell-extension-appindicator
- tiling assistant (for better snapping)
https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3733/tiling-assistant/
https://github.com/Leleat/Tiling-Assistant
- quick close in overview
https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/352/middle-click-to-close-in-overview/
https://github.com/p91paul/middleclickclose

https://github.com/p91paul/middleclickclose

- dconf editor
	in /org/gnome/desktop/peripherals/touchpad/ disable tap-and-drag
	in /org/gnome/desktop/peripherals/keyboard/ change delay to 300
	in /org/gnome/nautilus/preferences/ enable always-use-location-entry in order to be able to click in the path
