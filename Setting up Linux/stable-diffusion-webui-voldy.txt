download anaconda 3 from https://www.anaconda.com/
place it in home directory
make sure it's executable
>> ~/Anaconda3-2022.05-Linux-x86_64.sh
add...
export PATH="/home/stdiff/anaconda3/bin:$PATH"
...to the bottom of .zshrc, then save it
>> source ~/.zshrc
close and reopen terminal
check that...
>> conda
...actually exists, if not you've got to get it into your path somehow

follow the instructions below from https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui

# Clone webui repo
git clone https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui.git
cd stable-diffusion-webui

# Create and activate conda env
conda env create -f environment-wsl2.yaml
conda activate automatic

[MY NOTE: AT THIS POINT YOU MAY NEED TO RUN
>> conda init zsh
TO GET CONDA INTO THE PATH AGAIN OR SOMETHING, I DON'T QUITE REMEMBER, BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO CLOSE AND REOPEN THE SHELL
THE POINT IS TO REMEMBER AFTER YOU DO THAT STUFF, TO CD BACK INTO THE STABLE DIFFUSION DIRECTORY
>> cd stable-diffusion-webui]

# (optional) install requirements for GFPGAN (upscaling)
wget https://github.com/TencentARC/GFPGAN/releases/download/v1.3.0/GFPGANv1.3.pth

mkdir repositories
git clone https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion.git repositories/stable-diffusion
git clone https://github.com/CompVis/taming-transformers.git repositories/taming-transformers
git clone https://github.com/sczhou/CodeFormer.git repositories/CodeFormer

start it with
>> python webui.py
when it says running on local URL:  http://127.0.0.1:7860, then you can go to that URL to use the program
